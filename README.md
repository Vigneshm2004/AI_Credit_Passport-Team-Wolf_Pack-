# 🚀 AI Credit Passport

**Decentralized AI-Driven Credit Scoring**  
*Empowering the Unbanked with Alternative Data and Blockchain*

---

## 📌 Overview
Over **1.7 billion adults worldwide** remain unbanked, excluded from essential financial services.  
Traditional credit scoring is **centralized, opaque, and exclusive**, often ignoring alternative data like freelancing, social influence, or coding activity.  

**AI Credit Passport** bridges this gap by generating an **AI-powered credit score** from alternative data and minting it as a **Soulbound Token (SBT)** on the **Aptos blockchain**.
